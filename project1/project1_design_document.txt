			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
- New thread member int64_t timer in timer.h . New struct list sleep_list  in timer.h .
- New function void thread_timer_decrement(void) . New function void thread_sleep(int64_t ticks) .
- New function void thread_wakeup(void) .
---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.
- Just call thread_sleep() . It puts the current running thread to sleep list.
- when timer interrupt occurs, the function thread_timer_decrement() occurs.
- This function decrement 'timer' member values of struct thread every time
- timer interrupt called.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?
- We added function thread_timer_decrement() called by thread_tick() called by
- timer interrupt handler. We just added one line(one function) in the thread_tick() which is
- called by the timer interrupt handler. And we solve the problem with just adding this which 
- is so little and efficient. We convinced that should minimize the amount of time spent in the timer
- interrupt handler.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
- Because this design is simple and light. Our new added structure is list which is 
- already in lib/kernel/list.c . We completed our works just using with already in 
- system. The advantage of ours is so light and easy to understand. 
			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
 - bool check_pri (in <thread_create> function : check whether new thread's priority is bigger than current thread's priority. If small, then chek_pri is true.
 - struct list_elem* l_elem (in <next_thread_to_run> function) : compared list_elem with the high_elem. It moves to l_elem->next per each loop.
 - struct list_elem* high_elem (in <next_thread_to_run> function) : high_elem is that its thread has the highest priority. Check and compare with all elements in the ready_list.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?
 - We thought it was complicated to sort ready_list. Therefore, instead of sorting the list in order of priority, we found and called the thread with the highest priority when next_thread_to_run function is called. Also, if the created thread had higher priority than the current thread when the thread_create, the created thread was yielded.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
